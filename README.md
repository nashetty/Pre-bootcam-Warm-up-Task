Task:
- We want you to copy the home page of AirBnB (mobile site, not desktop) - https://www.airbnb.co.uk/.

- Take the web page we’ve given you, step through it and break down the design.
    - Look for sections.
    - Look for repetition.
    - Look for components.
    - ** Remember you can take a full page screenshot and annotate it. Give things really well considered names.
    - Don’t worry about anything interactive (menus that pop open etc, we’ve not covered JavaScript yet)
      
- Take that understanding (design breakdown) - now create tasks on your project so you can tackle the build bit by bit. Less than 10 tasks tells us you need to break down the design/work into smaller parts.
- We would like you to practice using git branches even though you’re working alone. For each task make a feature branch off the main branch. Carefully consider your branch names and make sure they’re short and match the task name. Do your work in that feature branch then once you’re happy it is complete merge your feature branch back into main, then push the updated main branch up to Github. Then you can mark that project task as closed.
- Repeat until you’ve completed the entire project.
- Once all the tasks for your project are complete we want you to quickly read a couple of best practice guides:
    - CSS: https://github.com/andredesousa/css-best-practices
    - HTML: https://github.com/hail2u/html-best-practices
    - Feel free to have a look for more guides or best practice lists.
- Now use that knowledge. Look through your code carefully and find at least five issues with your code. Create a new project task (label it as a “fix” or “bug”) for each issue you want to fix.
- Repeat the branching/building/merging step for each fix task until you’ve done them all.

  Deliverables:
- A web page that looks like the web page we’ve asked you to copy.
    - We want this to look as close as possible to the real deal.
    - Don’t worry about anything interactive (menus that pop open etc, we’ve not covered JavaScript yet)
- A project board that shows really good planning.
    - Small tasks.
    - Short but descriptive titles for each.
    - Descriptions for each task.
    - Each task changed from “open” to “closed” when the feature branch has been merged into main and the main branch has been pushed up to Github.
- A clean commit history.
    - Short and uniform commit messages.
    - Commit messages should be descriptive.
